# ALU Student Registration System Shell Application

## Overview
This project aims to simplify student registration at ALU by developing a custom shell application. Additionally, it automates file management tasks using Linux scripting to streamline administrative processes. The goal is to enhance the registration experience for both students and administrators.

## Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a compatible shell environment (e.g., bash).
3. Run the main.sh script using the command `./main.sh`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the application.

## Usage
The main features of the application include:
- Creating student records
- Saving records to a file (`students-list_1023.txt`)
- Viewing all saved student records
- Deleting records by student ID
- Updating records by student ID
- Searching and sorting student emails
- Saving emails to a separate file (`student-emails.txt`)

## File Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `main.sh`: Main shell script for the application
- `select-emails.sh`: Script for selecting student emails
- `Students-list_1023.txt`: File containing student records
- `student-emails.txt`: File containing selected student emails
